# MyTriangles
This project implements triangle intersection tests in 3D space. 
An octree is used to optimize the program's performance. 
As input, the program receives the number of triangles and their coordinates. 
Then there is the insertion of triangles into the octree and checks for intersection for triangles that are in the same octant. 
Google tests are used for testing. At the moment, the project has not yet passed all tests and is at the finalization stage.
