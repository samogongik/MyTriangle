# MyTriangles
This project implements triangle intersection tests in 3D space. An octree is used to optimize the program's performance.

Input: number of triangles and their coordinates.

Output: the number of each triangle that intersects with any other

After insertion of triangles into the octree program checks for intersection for triangles that are in the same octant.

At the moment, the project has not completed all tests and is in the final stages of development.
